# Coding Style

You can run npm run lint to show any style issues detected by ``tslint``.

Mostly follow [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide). 



## Typescript and Javascript

- End files with a newline.
- File names should be concatenated with ``-`` instead of ``_``, e.g. ``file-name.ts`` rather than ``file_name.ts``.
- Use indent size as 4.
- Use semicolon to terminate statements always.
- Use single quotes always.
- Add trailing comma when multiline.
- Space within object literal braces.
- Space within ES6 import/export braces.
- Chop down if ES6 import/export is long.
- Keep 2 spaces after imports.
- Sort imports by modules. (Third-party modules goes first)
